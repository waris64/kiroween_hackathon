# 🎬 3-Minute Video Script (Simple Version)

## 0:00-0:20 | INTRO
**Show:** Landing page

Every codebase has dead code. Files abandoned for months. Technical debt that's invisible.

I'm presenting SPECTRAL Code Cemetery - competing in Resurrection and Costume Contest.

We transform Git repositories into haunted cemeteries where you can see, understand, and resurrect dead code.

---

## 0:20-0:50 | HOME PAGE DEMO
**Show:** Type URL → Click Analyze → Loading → Cemetery

Let me show you. I'll analyze this repository.

While it analyzes, here's what's happening: cloning the repo, analyzing Git history, calculating health scores, and generating AI narratives.

---

## 0:50-1:20 | CEMETERY (COSTUME CONTEST)
**Show:** Pan cemetery → Hover tombstones → Click tombstone

This is the Costume Contest category. Each tombstone represents a dead file. The darker it is, the longer it's been abandoned.

Floating ghost particles. Fog effects. Smooth animations. Spooky purple and bone colors.

AI generates epitaphs for each file. You can see the full history - commits, contributors, health score.

---

## 1:20-1:50 | RESURRECTION PAGE
**Show:** Navigate to Resurrection → Select file → Show before/after

Now the Resurrection category. This is where we bring dead code back to life.

AI analyzes the code and suggests modernization.

NULL becomes nullptr. Old syntax becomes modern best practices. Dead code gets resurrected with today's standards.

---

## 1:50-2:25 | KIRO FEATURES
**Show:** VS Code .kiro directory → Each folder → Test results

We used ALL FIVE Kiro features.

Five specs - architecture, API, Git analyzer, AI integration, UI components.

Three steering docs - code standards, component patterns, Halloween theme.

Three agent hooks - auto-commit, component generator, test generator.

Two MCP servers - GitHub integration and code analysis.

And vibe coding throughout for the Git analysis engine.

Result: 43 passing tests. Production-ready in 25 hours instead of 50.

---

## 2:25-2:50 | TECHNICAL + TIME TRAVEL
**Show:** Code/tests → Docker → Time Travel page → Scrub timeline

Full-stack React and Node.js. Google Gemini AI. Custom Git analysis engine.

43 passing tests, 85% coverage. Docker deployment.

Time travel feature lets you navigate through repository history and watch files come to life and die over time.

## 2:50-3:00 | CLOSING
**Show:** Cemetery with logo → GitHub URL
