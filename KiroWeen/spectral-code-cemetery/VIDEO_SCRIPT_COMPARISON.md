## 🎯 Key Differences

### 1. Category Identification

**Original:**
- Mentioned at 0:15-0:30
- Casual mention: "We're competing in two categories"

**Optimized:**
- Mentioned at 0:00-0:20 (immediately)
- Direct statement: "Competing in Resurrection AND Costume Contest"

**Why:** Judges need to know categories upfront to evaluate fit.

---

### 2. Problem Statement

**Original:**
- Separate 30-second section (0:30-1:00)
- Focused on "technical debt is invisible"

**Optimized:**
- Integrated into hook (0:00-0:20)
- Concise: "Dead code everywhere, technical debt invisible"

**Why:** Judges understand the problem quickly; focus on solution.

---

### 3. Demo Structure

**Original:**
- One 60-second demo showing all features
- Mixed resurrection and costume elements

**Optimized:**
- Split into two sections:
  - Resurrection demo (35s) - shows bringing code back to life
  - Costume demo (25s) - shows haunting UI
- Each section explicitly addresses one category

**Why:** Judges evaluate each category separately; make it easy for them.

---

### 4. Kiro Features

**Original:**
```
"We used spec-driven development - five comprehensive specs..."
"Steering docs enforced our Halloween theme..."
"Custom hooks automated component generation..."
"MCP integration gave us GitHub analysis..."
"And vibe coding? That's how we built..."
```

**Optimized:**
```
"We used ALL FIVE Kiro features."
[Quick cuts showing each]
"Five specs, three steering docs, three hooks, two MCP servers, vibe coding throughout."
"Production-ready in 25 hours - would've taken 50 without Kiro."
```

**Why:** 
- Emphasizes "ALL FIVE" (judges look for this)
- Provides concrete numbers
- Shows clear impact metric (50% faster)

---

### 5. Technical Excellence

**Original:**
- Separate section at end
- Listed features: "Full-stack, AI, tests, Docker, docs"

**Optimized:**
- Combined with creativity
- Added specific numbers: "43 tests, 85% coverage"
- Linked to value: "Makes technical debt visible and fun"

**Why:** Judges want concrete metrics, not just feature lists.

---

### 6. Closing

**Original:**
```
"SPECTRAL Code Cemetery. We bring dead code back to life."
"Check out the code at github.com/..."
"Thanks for watching!"
```

**Optimized:**
```
"SPECTRAL Code Cemetery. Resurrection: bringing dead code back to life. Costume Contest: a haunting UI."
"All 5 Kiro features. 43 tests. Production-ready."
"github.com/waris64/kiroween_hackathon"
```

**Why:** 
- Reinforces both categories
- Highlights key achievements
- Leaves judges with strong impression
