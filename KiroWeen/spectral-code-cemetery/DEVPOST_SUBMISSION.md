### ✅ **7. DevPost Submission Requirements**

#### **Project Title**
```
🎃 SPECTRAL Code Cemetery - Visualize Your Dead Code with AI
```

#### **Tagline** (60 characters max)
```
Turn abandoned code into a haunted cemetery with AI narratives
```

#### **Description** (Detailed)

```markdown
## Inspiration
Every codebase has "dead code" - files that haven't been touched in months or years. We wanted to visualize this in a fun, Halloween-themed way while providing insights through AI.

## What it does
SPECTRAL Code Cemetery analyzes Git repositories and:
- 🪦 Creates a visual cemetery of abandoned files (tombstones)
- 👻 Generates AI-powered ghost personas for contributors
- 📜 Writes spooky epitaphs for dead code files
- ⏰ Enables time travel through Git history
- 🔮 Suggests code resurrection with AI modernization

## How we built it
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **AI:** Google Gemini API for narratives
- **Git Analysis:** Custom Git analyzer with NodeGit
- **Development:** Kiro AI for spec-driven development
- **Testing:** Jest with 43 passing tests

## Challenges we ran into
- Parsing complex Git histories efficiently
- Generating contextual AI narratives
- Creating smooth animations for cemetery visualization
- Configuring Jest with ES modules
- Managing state across complex component trees

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- ✅ Full-stack application in 20-25 hours
- ✅ 43 passing unit tests with 85%+ coverage
- ✅ Beautiful, responsive Halloween-themed UI
- ✅ AI integration that generates creative narratives
- ✅ Complete documentation and demo guide
- ✅ Extensive use of Kiro AI for development

## What we learned
- Advanced Git analysis techniques
- AI prompt engineering for creative outputs
- React animation with Framer Motion
- Spec-driven development with Kiro
- Property-based testing strategies

## What's next for SPECTRAL Code Cemetery
- GitHub OAuth integration
- Real-time collaboration features
- More AI-powered insights (code smells, refactoring suggestions)
- Export cemetery as shareable image
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Support for more version control systems (GitLab, Bitbucket)
```
