## 🎬 VIDEO SCRIPT

### [0:00-0:20] HOOK + INTRO (20 seconds)

*[Show: Landing page with logo and title]*

Every codebase has dead code. Files abandoned for months. Technical debt that's invisible.

I'm presenting SPECTRAL Code Cemetery - competing in Resurrection and Costume Contest.

We transform Git repositories into haunted cemeteries where you can see, understand, and resurrect dead code.

---

### [0:20-0:50] DEMO START - HOME PAGE (30 seconds)

*[Show: Type repository URL in input field]*

Let me show you. I'll analyze this repository.

*[Show: Click "Analyze Repository" button]*

*[Show: Loading screen with "Summoning the spirits..." animation]*

While it analyzes, here's what's happening: cloning the repo, analyzing Git history, calculating health scores, and generating AI narratives.

*[Show: Cemetery view appears with tombstones and floating ghosts]*

---

### [0:50-1:20] CEMETERY VIEW - COSTUME CONTEST (30 seconds)

*[Show: Pan across cemetery with tombstones, ghosts, and fog]*

This is the Costume Contest category. Each tombstone represents a dead file. The darker it is, the longer it's been abandoned.

*[Show: Hover over tombstones to show animations]*

Floating ghost particles. Fog effects. Smooth animations. Spooky purple and bone colors.

*[Show: Click on a tombstone to open modal]*

AI generates epitaphs for each file. You can see the full history - commits, contributors, health score.

---

### [1:20-1:50] RESURRECTION PAGE (30 seconds)

*[Show: Navigate to Resurrection page]*

Now the Resurrection category. This is where we bring dead code back to life.

*[Show: Select a file and click "Resurrect Code"]*

AI analyzes the code and suggests modernization.

*[Show: Before and after code comparison]*

NULL becomes nullptr. Old syntax becomes modern best practices. Dead code gets resurrected with today's standards.

---

### [1:50-2:25] KIRO FEATURES (35 seconds)

*[Show: VS Code with .kiro directory open]*

We used ALL FIVE Kiro features.

*[Show: specs folder]*

Five specs - architecture, API, Git analyzer, AI integration, UI components.

*[Show: steering folder]*

Three steering docs - code standards, component patterns, Halloween theme.

*[Show: hooks folder]*

Three agent hooks - auto-commit, component generator, test generator.

*[Show: mcp folder]*

Two MCP servers - GitHub integration and code analysis.

*[Show: terminal or code]*

And vibe coding throughout for the Git analysis engine.

*[Show: test results]*

Result: 43 passing tests. Production-ready in 25 hours instead of 50.

---

### [2:25-2:50] TECHNICAL + TIME TRAVEL (25 seconds)

*[Show: Code or architecture diagram]*

Full-stack React and Node.js. Google Gemini AI. Custom Git analysis engine.

*[Show: Docker compose or test results]*

43 passing tests, 85% coverage. Docker deployment.

*[Show: Navigate to Time Travel page]*

Time travel feature lets you navigate through repository history and watch files come to life and die over time.

*[Show: Scrub through timeline]*

---

### [2:50-3:00] CLOSING (10 seconds)

*[Show: Cemetery view with logo]*

SPECTRAL Code Cemetery. Resurrection and Costume Contest.

All 5 Kiro features. Production-ready.

*[Show: GitHub URL]*
